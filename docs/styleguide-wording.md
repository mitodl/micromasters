# Styleguide: Wording & Phrasing

We should be consistent in how we refer to key ideas and phrase key terms
in this project. Inconsistency is confusing, expecially for students who are
trying to learn! This styleguide will define how to refer to these key ideas
and key terms correctly.

Note that this styleguide only applies for text that is visible to users.
Internal references, such as in code, do not need to conform to this styleguide
(although they should, if possible).

## Education Terms

### MicroMasters

Both "M"s should always be capitalized. No apostrophe before the final "s".

### master's degree

The "m" should not be capitalized unless it is the first word in a sentence.
There should be an apostrophe before the final "s". It is acceptable to leave
off the word "degree" and simply refer to a "master's", but you should still
include the apostrophe before the final "s".

## Companies

### edX

The "e" should not be capitalized unless it is the first word in a sentence.
The "X" should always be capitalized.

### MITx

The letters "MIT" should always be capitalized. The letter "x" should never
be capitalized.
